// This file keeps the app-state machinery alive across Docker daemon outages
// (a dockerd restart or upgrade, Docker Desktop stopping at user logout, a
// crashed daemon coming back). The container-event stream is the signal: the
// docker client delivers exactly one error per Events stream and it is up to
// the caller to reopen it, so a dying stream is both the outage detector and
// the point where recovery must be driven. Without this supervision the
// spawner died permanently on the first daemon outage and nothing ever
// reconciled the app states once the daemon returned — app containers (which
// run with RestartPolicy "no") stayed stopped while the agent kept reporting
// them RUNNING until the next WAMP reconnect or agent restart.
