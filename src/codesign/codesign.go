// Package codesign verifies that a binary was Authenticode-signed by
// IronFlock's own code-signing key, independent of whatever certificate
// authorities the machine happens to trust.
//
// It is used to authenticate self-update payloads the Windows service
// downloads and executes as SYSTEM. The SHA-256 manifest checked in
// system.downloadBinary is NOT an authenticity anchor — it is fetched from the
// same origin as the binary and skipped when absent — so the pinned signature
// is the real defense against a compromised distribution server.
//
// Pinning is chainless with respect to the machine store: the signer must
// chain to OUR embedded root, so a device that trusts many enterprise CAs
// still won't accept a binary signed by a different one.
