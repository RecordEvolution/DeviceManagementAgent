// Windowed log queries answer "what did this app say around the time it broke?"

// agent's own stores, and neither can answer a windowed question: the in-memory
// ring holds 100 bare strings with no timestamps (LogEntry has none), and the
// SQLite LogHistory table is a single JSON blob per app/stage with no timestamp
// column, written only when a log stream ends. Docker's json-file driver is the
// one store on the device that stamps every record, so a query goes there
// first, falls back to the compose CLI for multi-container apps, and only drops
// to the agent's history when the container is gone — flagging that the
// requested window was NOT applied rather than pretending it was.
